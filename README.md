## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with BotWizardTS:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abdallah-Alwarawreh/BotWizardTS.git
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
cd BotWizardTS
npm install
```

3. Configure your bot token:

   - Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
   - Open the `.env` file and replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` with your Discord bot token. You can obtain a token by creating a new bot on the Discord Developer Portal.

4. Build the TypeScript code:

```bash
npm run build
```

5. Start the bot:

```bash
npm start
```

## Creating Slash Commands

To create a new slash command, follow these steps:

1. Create a new TypeScript file under the `src/Commands/<CommandCategory>/<CommandName>.ts` directory.
2. Define your command using the provided decorators and interfaces.
3. Implement the command's functionality.

Here's an example of a simple ping command:

```typescript
import { Command } from "../../Structures/Command";

export default new Command({
    name: "ping",
    description: "reply with pong",
    run: async( {interaction} ) => {
        interaction.followUp({
            content: "Pong!",
        });
    }
});
```

Make sure to import the necessary decorators and interfaces from the `discord.js` library.

## Handling Discord Events

BotWizardTS provides an event system that allows you to handle various Discord events. To create an event handler, follow these steps:

1. Create a new TypeScript file under the `src/Events/<EventName>.ts` directory.
2. Define your event handler using the provided decorators and interfaces.
3. Implement the event handling logic.

Here's an example of a simple message event handler:

```typescript
import { CommandInteractionOptionResolver } from "discord.js";
import { Event } from "../Structures/Event";
import { client } from "../app";
import { ExtendedInteraction } from "../typings/Command";

export default new Event("messageCreate", async (message) => {
    console.log(message.content);
});
```
